## Models

**`base-MoMu`**: original model trained on contrast-XL base dataset.
- `base-contrast`: code for contrastive pre-training
- `base-downstream`: code for fine-tuning on downstream tasks

**`new-MoMu`** [WIP]: lightweight model family trained for experimental purposes. 
- `new-contrast` [WIP]: code to perform contrastive pre-training with mini-MoMum on the smaller contrast-pretrain datasets
- `new-downstream` [WIP]: code to evaluate performance on a downstream task.


## Tasks

### Contrastive pre-training

The multimodal models are pre-trained on a joint molecular graph-text corpus dataset through contrastive learning.
We then benchmark the performance of these pre-trained models by fine-tuning them on downstream tasks below.

### Graph retrieval
Task: given the name of a molecule, generating the corresponding molecular graph.

### Molecular caption
Task: given a molecule graph, generate natural language describing the molecule.

### Molecular prediction
Task: given a molecule, predict its properties.

### Molecular generation
Task: given a natural language input, generate a molecule that fits the description.


## Data

We are working on providing online access to the various datasets on HuggingFace.
